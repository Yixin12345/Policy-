    "The provided document is an insurance product brochure (MetLife LTC LifeStage Advantage). It does not contain facility invoice, CMR form, or UB-04 claim data (invoice numbers, policy/claim service dates, line items, provider billing tax IDs, signatures, etc.).",
    "All three target sections (facilityInvoice, cmrForm, ub04) are intentionally left empty because no applicable evidence was found in the OCR fields/tables. Fields such as company_name and company_address are present but part of brochure/legal footer and not invoice/provider billing information; therefore sections were not populated."
