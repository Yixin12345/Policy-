    "Fields were populated only when explicit evidence exists in the extraction JSON (pages and fieldIds referenced). If no explicit textual evidence was found for a field, that field is set to null per instructions.",
    "Where the policy text points to values being shown on the Benefit Schedule (e.g., exact Elimination Period number, daily benefit amounts, Benefit Amounts), the canonical field notes that amounts are 'shown on the Benefit Schedule' rather than inventing numeric values.",
    "Confidence values reflect extraction confidences and degree of specificity in the policy text: commonly 0.8 for clear definitions, 0.6 where the table-of-contents-like or benefit text had lower extraction confidence or described policy limits (e.g., daily benefit caps referenced as 'shown on the Benefit Schedule').",
    "Two 'Additional Benefits' fields were filled with prominent additional/ancillary benefits present in the policy (Alternative Plan of Care and Personal Care Advisor) because these are explicitly described in the document.",
    "No Azure Search snippets were available; all sources are from the provided extraction JSON. Fields such as 'Ambulating', 'Medications', 'Prescription Drugs', inflation options, and specific monetary limits were left null due to lack of explicit evidence."
